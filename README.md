# "Project Name"
## Overview
This project demonstrates <u>E</u>xtracting, <u>T</u>ransforming and <u>L</u>oading data so that it is ready for analyses. The project sets up a functioning PostrgeSQL database that  stores video game sales and world population data. While the project does not perform any further analyses, this dataabse could be used to answer questions like which video game title has the  highest grossing sales per capita or which video game plaform is most popular (measured by sales of gameson that platform). The two data sets are [World Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset) and [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales), found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
