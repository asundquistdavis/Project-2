### Overview
We plan to complete the ETL process for video game sales and world population data so that it could be analysed further (i.e. sales per capita trends across different genres of video games). We will use two data sets, one for [World Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset) and the other for [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales); both can be obtained on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 
### Datasets
- [World Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset) (2.58 KB)
- [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) (1.36 MB)
### Major Tasks
- Raw Data Acquisition: Collectively on night 1
- ERD and Postgres Setup: Collectively on night 1
